# <p align="center"> **Welcome to TickVote's repository!** </p>
TickVote is a Spigot-based plugin that allows servers to implement a voting system where players may vote for specific ticks (times)! Vault is built-in as well, which allows for economy-implementation if desired.

### <p align="center"> Additional Info </p>
This is my first publically-released plugin, which was requested from a friend of mine. TickVote is updated with each Minecraft update (shouldn't break with any for the forseeable future), in addition to content updates that are released during my free-time :)
